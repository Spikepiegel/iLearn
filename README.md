<h2 align="left"> Information </h2> 
<p> This is my first pet project that I have done to make the opportunity to learn English more accessible. Thanks to this project, I gained a lot of new knowledge and used the existing ones. </p>

<p><strong>⚙️ The application has the following functions:</strong></p>
<li> Improving the vocabulary of English words </li>
<li> Statistics on learned words </li> 
<li> Learning and repeating words using a quiz game based on the Ebbinghaus method </li>
